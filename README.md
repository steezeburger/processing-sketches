# processing-sketches

a collection of some of my Processing sketches.

## running the javascript sketches

* simply open the `index.html` file in your browser

## creating your own javascript sketch
* `$ cd processingjs && cp -r _vendor/p5js-boilerplate your-project-name`

## running the rust sketches

* TODO

NOTE: this repo is super messy, including static js and css assets. i never intended to host these publicly. the goal
when generative coding is to get ideas out as quickly as possible, so i do not generally spend any time on
infrastructure or dependency organization.
